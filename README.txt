# Project Title

This Solidity program is to create a custom Token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This program is to create a custom Token on the Ethereum blockchain with the help of Solidity. Crypto tokens are digital representations of interest in an asset or used to facilitate transactions on a blockchain. We can set a Token name, abbreviation and also mint amount. There are other projects also included in this repo.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Clone this repository locally using `git clone`
* Get the Solidity files.

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code that are present in this repo.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "myToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed!
